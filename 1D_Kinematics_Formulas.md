## II. Problem Solving

**A particle’s position in a horizontal particle accelerator as a function of time is**
$x(t) = 2 \cos(5t) \, \text{m}$, **where $t$ is in seconds. The particle’s starting point is the origin.**

---

### a. What is the particle’s position after 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$x(10) = 2 \cos(50) \approx 2 \cdot 0.96497 = \boxed{1.93 \, \text{m}}$

---

### b. What is the particle’s velocity at 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -10 \sin(5t)$
$v(10) = -10 \sin(50) \approx -10 \cdot (-0.26237) = \boxed{2.62 \, \text{m/s}}$

### c. What is the particle’s acceleration at 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -50 \cos(5t)$
$a(10) = -50 \cos(50) \approx -50 \cdot 0.96497 = \boxed{-48.25 \, \text{m/s}^2}$

### 1. Instantaneous Velocity Function

**Question:**  
The position of an object in meters along a straight line as a function of time is given by  
`x(t) = t^3 - 5t^2 + 4t`.  
This is the object’s instantaneous velocity as a function of time.
