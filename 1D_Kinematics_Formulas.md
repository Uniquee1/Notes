## I. Multiple Choice

**Choose the letter of the best answer.**

### **1.**

**The position of a particle in a particle accelerator is defined by**
$x(t) = t^3 + t^2 + t$ **meters. This is the particle’s position at** $t = 2 \, \text{s}$.
**a.** 3 m  **b.** 4 m  **c.** 14 m  **d.** 16 m

**Solution:**
$x(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \, \text{m}$
✅ **Answer: c. 14 m**

---

### **2.**

**In problem #1, this gives the particle’s instantaneous velocity as a function of time.**
**a.** $v(t) = t^3 + t^2 + t$
**b.** $v(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 1$
**c.** $v(t) = t^3 + t^2 + 1$
**d.** $v(t) = t$

**Solution:**
Velocity is the derivative of position:
$v(t) = \frac{d}{dt}(t^3 + t^2 + t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 1$
✅ **Answer: b. $v(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 1$**

### **3.**

**A jogger walks to the east at a constant speed of 0.9 m/s. This is the jogger’s acceleration.**
**a.** 0.9 m/s² **b.** 1.0 m/s² **c.** 1.9 m/s² **d.** 0 m/s²

**Solution:**
Constant speed → no change in velocity → acceleration = 0
✅ **Answer: d. 0 m/s²**

---

### **4.**

**In problem #3, this is the jogger’s velocity after 3 seconds.**
**a.** 0.9 m/s² **b.** 0.9 m/s **c.** –0.9 m/s **d.** 1.0 m/s

**Solution:**
Constant velocity = 0.9 m/s
✅ **Answer: b. 0.9 m/s**

---

### **5.**

**In problem #3, this is the jogger’s displacement after 20 seconds.**
**a.** 20 meters **b.** –20 meters **c.** 18 meters **d.** –18 meters

**Solution:**
Displacement = velocity × time = $0.9 \times 20 = 18 \, \text{m}$
✅ **Answer: c. 18 meters**

### **6.**

**A coin is tossed up and reaches its maximum height at** $t = 2 \, \text{s}$.
**This is true:**
**a.** The coin’s initial and final velocities are equal.
**b.** At maximum height, acceleration due to gravity is 0.
**c.** At maximum height, acceleration due to gravity turns positive.
**d.** At maximum height, velocity is zero.

**Solution:**
At the top, velocity = 0, but gravity still acts downward.
✅ **Answer: d. At maximum height, velocity is zero.**

### **7.**

**A crumpled ball of paper is dropped from the third floor of a building.**
**Ignoring air resistance, this is the ball’s velocity after 2 seconds.**
**a.** 2 m/s **b.** –9.8 m/s **c.** –19.6 m/s **d.** 19.6 m/s

**Solution:**
$v = gt = 9.8 \times 2 = 19.6 \, \text{m/s} \downarrow \Rightarrow -19.6 \, \text{m/s}$
✅ **Answer: c. –19.6 m/s**

---

### **8.**

**In problem #7, this is the ball’s acceleration after 2 seconds.**
**a.** –9.8 m/s² **b.** 9.8 m/s² **c.** –9.8 m/s **d.** 9.8 m/s²

**Solution:**
Gravity is constant acceleration = –9.8 m/s²
✅ **Answer: a. –9.8 m/s²**

---

### **9.**

**A particle’s velocity in m/s that travels in a straight line as a function of time $t$ is given by**
$v = 5t^2 + t$. This is true:
**a.** Velocity is constant.
**b.** Acceleration is constant.
**c.** Acceleration is not uniform.
**d.** Average velocity is 5 m/s.

**Solution:**
Acceleration = derivative of velocity = $a(t) = 10t + 1$ → not constant
✅ **Answer: c. Acceleration is not uniform.**

---

### **10.**

**In problem #9, this is the particle’s acceleration at** $t = 1 \, \text{s}$.
**a.** 9 m/s² **b.** 10 m/s² **c.** 11 m/s² **d.** 12 m/s²

**Solution:**
$a(1) = 10(1) + 1 = 11 \, \text{m/s}^2$
✅ **Answer: c. 11 m/s²**

---

## II. Problem Solving

**A particle’s position in a horizontal particle accelerator as a function of time is**
$x(t) = 2 \cos(5t) \, \text{m}$, **where $t$ is in seconds. The particle’s starting point is the origin.**

---

### a. What is the particle’s position after 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$x(10) = 2 \cos(50) \approx 2 \cdot 0.96497 = \boxed{1.93 \, \text{m}}$

---

### b. What is the particle’s velocity at 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -10 \sin(5t)$
$v(10) = -10 \sin(50) \approx -10 \cdot (-0.26237) = \boxed{2.62 \, \text{m/s}}$

---

### c. What is the particle’s acceleration at 10 seconds?

**Solution:**
$a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -50 \cos(5t)$
$a(10) = -50 \cos(50) \approx -50 \cdot 0.96497 = \boxed{-48.25 \, \text{m/s}^2}$
