1. **The position of an object in meters along a straight line as a function of time is given by \( x(t) = t^3 - 5t^2 + 4t \). This is the object's instantaneous velocity as a function of time.**
   - **Solution:** The instantaneous velocity \( v(t) \) is the first derivative of the position function \( x(t) \).
     \[
     v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - 5t^2 + 4t) = 3t^2 - 10t + 4
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{b} \)

2. **In #1, this is the object's instantaneous velocity when \( t = 2 \) s.**
   - **Solution:** Using the velocity function \( v(t) = 3t^2 - 10t + 4 \), substitute \( t = 2 \):
     \[
     v(2) = 3(2)^2 - 10(2) + 4 = 3(4) - 20 + 4 = 12 - 20 + 4 = -4 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{a} \)

3. **The velocity in m/s along a straight line of a particle as a function of time is given by \( v(t) = 3t^2 - 8t \). At \( t = 2 \) seconds, this is true.**
   - **Solution:** Substitute \( t = 2 \) into the velocity function:
     \[
     v(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8(2) = 3(4) - 16 = 12 - 16 = -4 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
     Since the velocity is negative, the direction of the object is to the left.
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{b} \)

4. **In #3, this is the particle's acceleration as a function of time.**
   - **Solution:** The acceleration \( a(t) \) is the first derivative of the velocity function \( v(t) \):
     \[
     a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 8t) = 6t - 8
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{a} \)

5. **If \( x = x(t) \) is the position of a particle along a straight line, and the first and second derivatives exist, this is true.**
   - **Solution:** 
     - \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) gives the particle's instantaneous velocity.
     - \( x''(t) \) or \( \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \) gives the particle's instantaneous acceleration.
     - Both statements are true.
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{d} \)

6. **A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 40 m/s. This is the ball's acceleration after 3 seconds.**
   - **Solution:** The acceleration of the ball is due to gravity, which is constant and equal to \( -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (negative because it acts downward).
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{d} \)

7. **In #6, this is the ball's velocity after 3 seconds.**
   - **Solution:** The velocity of the ball as a function of time is given by:
     \[
     v(t) = v_0 - gt = 40 - 9.8t
     \]
     Substitute \( t = 3 \):
     \[
     v(3) = 40 - 9.8(3) = 40 - 29.4 = 10.6 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{c} \)

8. **The velocity of object X that travels in a straight line is given by \( v = 4 \, \text{m/s} \). Assume uniform motion. This is the object's displacement after 10 seconds.**
   - **Solution:** Displacement for uniform motion is given by:
     \[
     \text{Displacement} = v \cdot t = 4 \cdot 10 = 40 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{d} \)

9. **The velocity of object Y that travels along a straight line is given by \( v = 4t \, \text{m/s} \). This is the object's displacement after 2 seconds.**
   - **Solution:** Displacement is the integral of velocity with respect to time:
     \[
     \text{Displacement} = \int_0^2 v(t) \, dt = \int_0^2 4t \, dt = 4 \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_0^2 = 4 \left( \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{4}{2} \right) = 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - **Answer:** \( \boxed{c} \)

10. **The position of an object in meters along a horizontal line is given by \( x(t) = 3e^{-t} \). This is the object's acceleration as a function of time.**
    - **Solution:** First, find the velocity \( v(t) \):
      \[
      v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(3e^{-t}) = 3(-e^{-t}) = -3e^{-t}
      \]
      Next, find the acceleration \( a(t) \):
      \[
      a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(-3e^{-t}) = -3(-e^{-t}) = 3e^{-t}
      \]
    - **Answer:** \( \boxed{c} \)
