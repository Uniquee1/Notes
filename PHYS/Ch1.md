## 📏 Activity 1.2 – Physical Quantities  
*(From: Gen_Phys_1.2_Physical-Quantities.pdf)*

### Short Answer

1. Give an example of a **derived quantity** and explain why it is derived.

   **Solution:**  
   Example: Speed. It is derived because it comes from dividing distance by time (m/s).  
   ✅ **Answer: Speed; derived from fundamental quantities**

---

2. What are the **fundamental quantities** involved in measuring the volume of a cube?

   **Solution:**  
   Volume = length × width × height → all are forms of length  
   ✅ **Answer: Length**

---

3. If you measure the mass of a pebble and divide it by its volume, what physical quantity do you get?

   **Solution:**  
   Density = mass/volume  
   ✅ **Answer: Density**

---

4. What is the unit of measurement for density?

   **Solution:**  
   Mass in grams, volume in cm³ → g/cm³  
   ✅ **Answer: g/cm³**

---

5. Why are some stains invisible even under visible light?

   **Solution:**  
   They only fluoresce under UV light  
   ✅ **Answer: Some substances reflect light outside the visible spectrum**

## 📊 Activity 1.3 – Uncertainty & Error Analysis  
*(From: Gen_Phys_1.3_Uncertainty_Error_Analysis.pdf)*

### Problem Solving

1. A projectile travels 18.0 ± 0.1 m in 3.0 ± 0.1 s. Estimate its speed.

   **Solution:**  
   Speed = distance/time = 18.0 / 3.0 = 6.0 m/s  
   ✅ **Answer: 6.0 m/s**

---

2. Find the sum of fractional uncertainties.

   **Solution:**  
   Fractional uncertainty = 0.1/18 + 0.1/3 = 0.0056 + 0.0333 ≈ 0.0389  
   ✅ **Answer: 0.04**

---

3. What is the uncertainty in the speed?

   **Solution:**  
   Uncertainty = 0.04 × 6.0 = 0.24 m/s  
   ✅ **Answer: ± 0.24 m/s**

---

4. Write the final measured speed with uncertainty.

   **Solution:**  
   Measured speed = estimate ± uncertainty  
   ✅ **Answer: 6.00 ± 0.24 m/s**

---

5. A lot has length = 10.0 ± 0.1 m and width = 5.0 ± 0.1 m. Compute the perimeter.

   **Solution:**  
   Perimeter = 2 × (length + width) = 2 × (10.0 + 5.0) = 30.0 m  
   Uncertainty = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 m  
   ✅ **Answer: 30.0 ± 0.2 m**

*(From: Gen_Phys_1.4_Graphical_analyisis.pdf)*

### Interpretation

1. What does the slope of a position-time graph represent?

   **Solution:**  
   Slope = change in position over time → velocity  
   ✅ **Answer: Velocity**

---

2. What does the area under a velocity-time graph represent?

   **Solution:**  
   Area = velocity × time → displacement  
   ✅ **Answer: Displacement**

---

3. A straight line on a velocity-time graph indicates:

   - **a. Constant speed**
   - **b. Constant acceleration**
   - **c. Zero acceleration**
   - **d. Changing velocity**

   **Solution:**  
   Straight horizontal line = constant velocity → zero acceleration  
   ✅ **Answer: c**

---

4. What does a curved line on a position-time graph indicate?

   - **a. Uniform motion**
   - **b. Accelerated motion**
   - **c. No motion**
   - **d. Constant velocity**

   **Solution:**  
   Curved line means changing slope → changing velocity → acceleration  
   ✅ **Answer: b**

---

5. Which graph best represents constant positive acceleration?

   - **a. Horizontal line on velocity-time graph**
   - **b. Diagonal line on velocity-time graph**
   - **c. Parabola on position-time graph**
   - **d. Both b and c**

   **Solution:**  
   Diagonal line on v-t = constant acceleration
