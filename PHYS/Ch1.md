### Problem Solving  

---

#### Question 1  
**A projectile travels 18.0 Â± 0.1 m in 3.0 Â± 0.1 s. Estimate its speed.**

**Solution:**  
Speed = distance / time  
Estimate of speed = 18.0 / 3.0 = 6.0 m/s  

Fractional uncertainty:  
- For distance: \( \frac{0.1}{18.0} = 0.0056 \)  
- For time: \( \frac{0.1}{3.0} = 0.0333 \)  

Total fractional uncertainty = \( 0.0056 + 0.0333 = 0.0389 \)  
Uncertainty in speed = \( 6.0 \times 0.0389 = 0.2334 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.24 \, \text{m/s} \)  

**Final Answer:**  
âœ… **6.00 Â± 0.24 m/s**

---

#### Question 2  
**A rectangular lot has a length of 10.0 Â± 0.1 m and a width of 5.0 Â± 0.1 m. Compute the perimeter.**

**Solution:**  
Perimeter = \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \)  
Estimate of perimeter = \( 2 \times (10.0 + 5.0) = 30.0 \, \text{m} \)  

Absolute uncertainties add directly:  
\( \Delta P = 2 \times (0.1 + 0.1) = 0.4 \, \text{m} \)  

**Final Answer:**  
âœ… **30.0 Â± 0.4 m**

---

#### Question 3  
**The mass of a crystal is 3.52 Â± 0.01 g, and its volume is 1.34 Â± 0.02 mL. Compute the density with uncertainty.**

**Solution:**  
Density = mass / volume  
Estimate of density = \( \frac{3.52}{1.34} = 2.63 \, \text{g/mL} \)  

Fractional uncertainties:  
- For mass: \( \frac{0.01}{3.52} = 0.0028 \)  
- For volume: \( \frac{0.02}{1.34} = 0.0149 \)  

Total fractional uncertainty = \( 0.0028 + 0.0149 = 0.0177 \)  
Uncertainty in density = \( 2.63 \times 0.0177 = 0.0466 \, \text{g/mL} \approx 0.05 \, \text{g/mL} \)  

**Final Answer:**  
âœ… **2.63 Â± 0.05 g/mL**

#### Question 4  
**The municipal government collected rainwater samples from five stations. The volumes (in cc) are: 3.5, 3.0, 4.1, 2.9, and 2.7. Find the mean, variance, standard deviation, and write the result with random error.**

**Solution:**  
Mean = \( \frac{\text{sum of measurements}}{\text{number of measurements}} \)  
\( \bar{x} = \frac{3.5 + 3.0 + 4.1 + 2.9 + 2.7}{5} = 3.24 \, \text{cc} \)  

Variance:  
\( \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n} \)  
\( \sigma^2 = \frac{(3.5 - 3.24)^2 + (3.0 - 3.24)^2 + (4.1 - 3.24)^2 + (2.9 - 3.24)^2 + (2.7 - 3.24)^2}{5} \)  
\( \sigma^2 = \frac{0.0676 + 0.0576 + 0.7396 + 0.1156 + 0.2916}{5} = 0.2544 \, \text{cc}^2 \)  

Standard deviation:  
\( \sigma = \sqrt{0.2544} = 0.50 \, \text{cc} \)  

**Final Answer:**  
âœ… **3.24 Â± 0.50 cc**

---

#### Question 5  
**Answer the following questions based on the bar graph with error bars:**  
a. Which station has the least average rainfall?  
b. Which station has the largest average rainfall?  
c. Which station has the least random error?  
d. Which station has the largest random error?  

**Solution:**  
Assume the bar graph data is as follows:  
- Station A: 3.0 Â± 0.2 cc  
- Station B: 4.5 Â± 0.1 cc  
- Station C: 2.8 Â± 0.3 cc  
- Station D: 5.0 Â± 0.4 cc  
- Station E: 2.5 Â± 0.2 cc  

a. Least average rainfall: Station E (2.5 cc)  
b. Largest average rainfall: Station D (5.0 cc)  
c. Least random error: Station B (Â±0.1 cc)  
d. Largest random error: Station D (Â±0.4 cc)  

**Final Answers:**  
âœ… **a. Station E**  
âœ… **b. Station D**  
âœ… **c. Station B**  
âœ… **d. Station D**

### Line-of-Best-Fit

#### Question 1  
**Study the scatter plot below and answer the following:**  
a. Draw \( l_1 \) (line-of-best-fit) and write its equation.  
b. Draw \( l_2 \) (less steep line) and \( l_3 \) (steeper line), and write their equations.  
c. Compute the uncertainty for slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \).  
d. Write the complete equation of the line-of-best-fit with uncertainty.  

**Solution:**  
Assume the scatter plot data is linear, and the points suggest:  
- \( l_1 \): Passes through (5, 10) and (12, 20)  
Slope of \( l_1 \):  
\( m_1 = \frac{20 - 10}{12 - 5} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.43 \)  
y-intercept of \( l_1 \):  
Using \( y = mx + b \), substitute (5, 10):  
\( 10 = 1.43(5) + b \Rightarrow b = 10 - 7.15 = 2.85 \)  
Equation of \( l_1 \):  
\( y = 1.43x + 2.85 \)  

For \( l_2 \) (less steep):  
Passes through (5, 10) and (9, 15)  
Slope of \( l_2 \):  
\( m_2 = \frac{15 - 10}{9 - 5} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \)  
y-intercept of \( l_2 \):  
Using \( y = mx + b \), substitute (5, 10):  
\( 10 = 1.25(5) + b \Rightarrow b = 10 - 6.25 = 3.75 \)  
Equation of \( l_2 \):  
\( y = 1.25x + 3.75 \)  

For \( l_3 \) (steeper):  
Passes through (5, 10) and (11, 20)  
Slope of \( l_3 \):  
\( m_3 = \frac{20 - 10}{11 - 5} = \frac{10}{6} \approx 1.67 \)  
y-intercept of \( l_3 \):  
Using \( y = mx + b \), substitute (5, 10):  
\( 10 = 1.67(5) + b \Rightarrow b = 10 - 8.35 = 1.65 \)  
Equation of \( l_3 \):  
\( y = 1.67x + 1.65 \)  

Uncertainty in slope:  
\( \Delta m = \frac{m_3 - m_2}{2} = \frac{1.67 - 1.25}{2} = 0.21 \)  

Uncertainty in y-intercept:  
\( \Delta b = \frac{b_3 - b_2}{2} = \frac{1.65 - 3.75}{2} = 1.05 \)  

**Final Answer:**  
âœ… **Line-of-best-fit with uncertainty: \( y = (1.43 \pm 0.21)x + (2.85 \pm 1.05) \)**
