## **Part I: Problems with Solutions**  

### **Problem 1**  
**Question:** Two cards are drawn from a deck of 52 cards one after another with replacement. What is the probability the first card is an ace of spades and the second is not a diamond card?  

**Solution:**  
- Probability of first card being ace of spades: \( \frac{1}{52} \).  
- Probability of second card not being a diamond: \( \frac{39}{52} = \frac{3}{4} \).  
- Combined probability (independent events): \( \frac{1}{52} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{208} \).  

**Answer:** \( \frac{3}{208} \).  

---

### **Problem 2**  
**Question:** Two cards are drawn without replacement. What is the probability the first is a king and the second is not the 8 of hearts?  

**Solution:**  
- Probability of first card being a king: \( \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \).  
- Probability of second card not being the 8 of hearts: \( \frac{51}{51} = 1 \) (since there’s only one 8 of hearts and it’s still in the deck if not drawn first).  
- Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{13} \times 1 = \frac{1}{13} \).  

**Answer:** \( \frac{1}{13} \).  

---

### **Problem 3**  
**Question:** Two cards are drawn without replacement. If the first card is a spade, what is the probability the second card is also a spade?  

**Solution:**  
- After drawing one spade, 12 spades remain out of 51 cards.  
- Probability: \( \frac{12}{51} = \frac{4}{17} \).  

**Answer:** \( \frac{4}{17} \).  

---

### **Problem 4**  
**Question:** A coin is tossed and a card is drawn. What is the probability of a tail and a black card?  

**Solution:**  
- Probability of tail: \( \frac{1}{2} \).  
- Probability of black card: \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \).  
- Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \).  

**Answer:** \( \frac{1}{4} \).  

---

### **Problem 5**  
**Question:** An urn has 5 balls: 2 black, 2 green, and 1 yellow. Three balls are drawn with replacement. What is the probability the first is black, the second is yellow, and the third is green?  

**Solution:**  
- Probabilities:  
  - Black: \( \frac{2}{5} \).  
  - Yellow: \( \frac{1}{5} \).  
  - Green: \( \frac{2}{5} \).  
- Combined probability: \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{125} \).  

**Answer:** \( \frac{4}{125} \).  

---
